_PATTERN_GEN_PROMPT = """\
The user told their desktop pet to enforce this rule: "{description}"

Your job: generate a list of LOWERCASE substrings that will be matched against \
browser tab titles and application window titles. A match triggers an automatic \
tab close and a scolding, so FALSE POSITIVES are very bad — they make the pet \
close innocent tabs and accuse the user of things they didn't do.

HARD RULES — FOLLOW EXACTLY:
1. Every pattern must be AT LEAST 5 characters long. No short fragments.
2. Every pattern must be SPECIFIC to the rule. Do NOT emit generic words that \
   could appear in unrelated pages (e.g. do not emit "video", "post", "forum", \
   "user", "login", "home", "search", "page", "site", "view").
3. Do NOT emit partial words or prefixes that could match unrelated sites. For \
   example: a rule against "reddit" must NOT emit "red", "edit", "ddit", \
   "booru", "twi", "bo", or any other substring that could match twibooru, \
   twitter, redbubble, or similar unrelated sites.
4. Each pattern should be a FULL identifier: a complete domain ("reddit.com", \
   "old.reddit.com"), a complete site slug ("pornhub"), a complete page-title \
   phrase ("shopping cart", "add to cart"), or a complete subreddit path \
   ("r/gonewild", "/r/all").
5. When in doubt, LEAVE IT OUT. Fewer, precise patterns > many loose patterns.
6. Prefer 15-40 tight patterns over 100+ loose ones.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output ONLY the patterns, one per line, lowercase. No numbering, no bullets, \
no explanations, no markdown, no headers."""
