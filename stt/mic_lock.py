"""
Global lock for PyAudio initialization/termination.

PortAudio (the C library under PyAudio) has global state — calling
Pa_Initialize and Pa_Terminate from multiple threads simultaneously
causes heap corruption and access violations.

Both the wake word detector and the transcriber create sr.Microphone
instances (which create/destroy PyAudio). This lock serializes those
calls while allowing actual audio capture to happen concurrently.
